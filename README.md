# Bank-Customer-Simulation
A program that simulates customers being helped at registers at a bank.

The goal of this project is to practice the use of different data structures and the use of comparators in a program.
* Main.java is the driver file
* Customer.java defines what a customer is using a class
* Event.java uses random number generation to determine what type of event happens during a tick
* CustomerCompare.java implements a comparator for the priorities of customers
